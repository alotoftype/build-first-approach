# Build First Approach

The point of this exercise is to understand the build first approach. A 
lot of the time when working with applications, the configuration has 
been set up for me. While I have learned to work with the tools included
in the application. I have never really fully gotten a grasp as to the 
reasoning behind using them, nor have I beeen able to understand how to 
set them up on my own. I would like to address this concern with this 
project. The end goal is to have a better understanding of the setup 
process. A secondary goal is to improve documentation of my process.
When working on projects I get caught up in the process of just coding 
away with a sort of mental plan. This plan usually goes awry and I 
become focused on just making things work. I then go back and try to 
remember my process. This usually leaves gap in my documentation. 
I am following the book [Javascript Application Design: A Build 
First Approach.](https://www.manning.com/books/javascript-application-design)
